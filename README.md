# 100 Days of Python Projects by Kacper Andrzejewski
This repository contains a selection of my most significant Python projects from the Python Pro Bootcamp (Udemy course). It demonstrates my skills in:
* Python programming
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Web scraping with Selenium
* Working with APIs
* Data analysis and visualization

All projects were completed independently and are supported by my official Udemy certificate.

Although I completed almost 60 projects during the course, this repository contains a curated selection to show diversity and range of skills.
